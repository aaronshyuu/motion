## Drawing Shapes with Mouse
This program allows the user to draw in a panel. When the mouse enters the panel, the panel turns white. The mouse will draw red circle outlines of length 50 pixels when it is dragged inside the window. A mouse click draws a yellow rectangle outline of size 100 pixels. While the mouse is clicked down and dragged, black rectangle outlines of size 50 pixels will continuously be drawn. When the mouse is detected outside of the window, the window is filled with cyan and reset.

## Bouncing Ball
This program presents an animation that displays a bouncing ball in a panel. The animation essentially paints and repaints the same scene, giving the illusion of a moving object. The animation will stop when the mouse is stopped (left click) and resumes when the mouse is released. Pressing the tab arrow key increases the animation speed while pressing the shift arrow key decreases the animation speed. Moreover, pressing the up, down, left and right arrow keys during the ball's movement will change the ball direction to only move in one direction. Pressing the control key advances the ball in a 2-D plane (ie. 45 degree angle)
